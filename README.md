# sudoku-java
A java version of my sudoku solver program. It is much more efficient.

Currently in early alpha. You must run with the .bat or .sh file in order for the program to work due to a required flag.
The current setup will simply solve 999 preloaded puzzles and report back with the speed.

# usage
Download the .zip from the latest release and run the executable appropriate for your OS (.bat on windows and .sh on linux or mac)
